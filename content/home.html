    <p>I am a final-year undergraduate student in Computer Science and Engineering at <a href="https://cse.osu.edu/" target="_blank">The Ohio State University</a> where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2mjUsP8AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Srinivasan Parthasarathy</a>.</p>
    <p>My primary research interests lie in the domain specialization of foundational machine learning models. How can we design automated systems that are more capable, fair and efficient?</p>
    <p>Currently, my work focuses on exploring this question using Meta's <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/">Llama 3.1</a> language model and <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/segment-anything-2/">SAM 2.1</a> vision model.</p>
